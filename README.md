# JK_Project_1
Hi! My name is Jai Kishan.
This is my first project on GitHub.
I know a little about computers. Although I formally learned Computers long back but never took it up as career. I was already employed and there was hardly any requirement of computer knowledge except that of MS Word for writing reports etc so far my office commitments were concerned. But fascination about computers was so much that first I joined week days classes at NIIT for 6 months and later on took 2 years study leave in the mid career to go for Post Graduate Diploma in Computer Application. It is a perishable skill if not used and updated continously. However I kept myself in the company of computers as they continue to attract me. I had not been coding but had learned DOS, Windos 3.1, Windows 95, FoxBase, FoxPro, Oracle, SQL, C, C++, HTML, HD Graphics etc during my Diploma days.  Lately I got fascinated about Machine Learning and in a bid to learn about it explored youtube. Soon I realized that without actual coding Machine Learning won't make sense. Initially I was bit hesitant to move forward thinking that programming might have gone too far from where I had came into its contact. But I kept watching conceptual videos about Machine Learning on youtube and found myself ready to explore programming too. I chose Python as I found it easy to understand. It was a pleasant surprise to notice that programming had not gone that far as I use to think. Basic logic remained same and programming evovled on its previous versions. I realized that present day high level languages are actually build on their low level versions. It gave me a boost to go for it. Soon another realization occured that I don't need to start learning from the scratch. Programming  has actually gone far. Even after watching hundreds of youtube tutorials I found it hard to match my coding skills to the required level. Thanks to Jake VanderPlas whom I heard saying in one of his videos that it is good to resist the urge to reinvent the wheel. I was trying to do actually this only. So many intelligent people have done so much intelligent programming which just cannot be matched by someone like me. Hence I decided not to reinvent the wheel.
